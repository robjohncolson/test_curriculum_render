By symmetry, 16% of the remaining times are less than 140 minutes, and 16% of the times are greater than 220 minutes.

Using technology or the standard normal table, the proportion of women who ran the marathon with a finishing time less than Kathy is approximately 0.66. Part (c): Since the standard deviation for women's times is greater than the standard deviation for men's times, there is more variability in the women's times than in the men's times.
