By symmetry, 16% of the remaining completion times are less than 45 minutes and 16% of the completion times are greater than 75 minutes. For the large puzzle, the empirical rule guarantees that approximately 68% of the times will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean of 180 minutes. By symmetry, 16% of the remaining times are less than 140 minutes, and 16% of the times are greater than 220 minutes.

What does this indicate about the finishing times of the women who ran the marathon compared to the finishing times of the men who ran the marathon?",
      "reasoning": "Part (a): Clay's finishing time was 289 minutes and the distribution of finishing time for men had a mean of 242 minutes and a standard deviation of 29 minutes. The standardized score for Clay's marathon time is: z = (289-242)/29 ≈ 1.62. Clay's finishing time is 1.62 standard deviations greater than the men's mean finishing time. Part (b): Kathy's finishing time was 272 minutes and the distribution of finishing time for women had a mean of 259 minutes and a standard deviation of 32 minutes. The standardized score for Kathy's marathon time is: z = (272-259)/32 ≈ 0.41. Using technology or the standard normal table, the proportion of women who ran the marathon with a finishing time less than Kathy is approximately 0.66. Part (c): Since the standard deviation for women's times is greater than the standard deviation for men's times, there is more variability in the women's times than in the men's times. This indicates that, on average, women's times are further away from the women's mean marathon time than the average distance men's times are away from the men's mean marathon time."

      "reasoning": "A negative relationship indicates a tendency for one variable to decrease as the other increases. Nonlinear indicates that the rate of decrease is not constant. In this case, the group size decreases quickly at first when woodland percentage is low, then decreases more slowly as woodland percentage continues to increase.",

As part of the investigation, the researchers set up devices along a two-mile stretch of road. When a deer approached a device, the device would activate and emit a sound. The researchers recorded whether the deer moved toward the highway (positive response), away from the highway (negative response), or did not move (neutral response). The researchers kept the loudness of the sound constant at 60 decibels. However, they varied the pitch of the sound. There were 6 treatment levels, all measured in kilohertz (\\(\\text{kHz}\\)): 0, 0.28, 1, 8, 15, and 28. The order of the treatments was randomly assigned.",

Fifty blocks made from the same wood were randomly assigned to be painted with either the new paint or the old paint. The blocks were placed into a weather-controlled room that simulated extreme weather conditions such as ice, temperature, wind, and sleet. After one month in the room, the blocks were removed, and each block was rated on texture, shine, brightness of color, and chipping. The results showed that the blocks painted with the new paint generally had higher ratings than the blocks painted with the old paint.

Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA fair die, with its faces numbered from 1 to 6, is one in which each number is equally likely to land face up when the die is rolled. On a fair die, the probability that the number 6 will land face up is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). A group of students wanted to investigate a claim about manipulating a fair die so that it favors one outcome. The claim states that if a fair die is put into an oven and baked at 200°F for 10 minutes, the inside of the die will begin to melt. When the die cools, the inside will be solid again, but with more weight toward the bottom. This shift in weight will cause the face that was up when the die cooled to land up more often that the other faces.\n\nThe students obtained a fair die and baked it according to the preceding directions. The die cooled with the number 6 face up. After the die cooled, they rolled the die 200 times, and the number 6 landed face up 43 times. Let \\(p\\) represent the population proportion of times the number 6 will land face up on the baked die if the die could be rolled an infinite number of times.\n\n(a) Clarke, one of the students, constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for \\(p\\) as \\(0.215 \\pm 0.057\\). Does the interval provide convincing statistical evidence that the number 6 will land face up more often on the baked die than on a fair die? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(b) Aurelia, another student, suggested they conduct a significance test to investigate the claim. She tested the hypotheses \\(H_0: p = \\frac{1}{6}\\) versus \\(H_a: p > \\frac{1}{6}\\) at the significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). She obtained a test statistic of \\(z = 1.83\\) with a p-value of 0.033. Do the results of the significance test agree with the results of Clarke's confidence interval in part (a)? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(c) Two standard normal curves are shown below, one for the confidence interval calculated in part (a) and one for the significance test conducted in part (b).\n\n(i) For the confidence interval curve, label the critical values for the 95% confidence level and shade the area that represents values in the outer 5%.\n\n(ii) For the significance test curve, label the critical value for the 5% significance level and shade the area representing the values of \\(z\\) that would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis in part (b).\n\n(d) Joachim, a third student, noted that the confidence interval in part (a) gives plausible values of the parameter as an interval between two values. He suggested that they develop a one-sided confidence interval because they were only concerned with whether the number 6 was landing face up more often than expected, not less often. The one-sided-interval will determine a value \\(L\\) such that all plausible values of \\(p\\) are greater than \\(L\\). The formula for \\(L\\) is \\(L = \\hat{p} - z^* \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\).\n\n(i) Determine the values of \\(z^*\\) needed to create the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval. Then calculate the value of \\(L\\).\n\n(ii) Do the results of Joachim's one-sided confidence interval agree with results of Aurelia's significance test in part (b)? Explain your reasoning.",

Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA team of psychologists studied the concept of visualization in basketball, where players visualize making a basket before shooting the ball. They conducted an experiment in which 20 basketball players with similar abilities were randomly assigned to two groups. The 10 players in group 1 received visualization training, and the 10 players in group 2 did not.\n\nEach player stood 22 feet from the basket at the same location on the basketball court. Each player was then instructed to attempt to make the basket until two consecutive baskets were made. The players who received visualization training were instructed to use visualization techniques before attempting to make the basket. The total number of attempts, including the last two attempts, were recorded for each player.\n\nThe total number of attempts for each of the 20 players are summarized in the following boxplots.\n\n(a) Based on the boxplots, did basketball players who received visualization training tend to need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than players who did not receive the training? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(b) State and check conditions for conducting a two-sample \\(t\\)-test for a difference in means.\n\nBecause both distributions, visualization and no visualization, are skewed, the psychologists conducted a simulation to test for a difference in medians rather than means. For each trial of the simulation, the 20 values of the total number of attempts observed in the experiment were combined into one group and then randomly split into two groups of 10. The difference in the medians \\((V - NV)\\) of the groups was calculated for each trial. The following dotplot shows the difference in the medians for 100 trials of the simulation.\n\n(c) Using the observed difference in medians \\((V - NV)\\) and the results of the simulation, estimate a \\(p\\)-value for a test for the difference in medians. Show the work needed to calculate this \\(p\\)-value.\n\n(d) Based on the \\(p\\)-value in part (c), is there convincing statistical evidence that basketball players similar to the ones in this study who receive visualization training need fewer attempts to make two consecutive baskets from a distance of 22 feet than those who do not receive such training?

To test the optimal foraging theory, researchers trapped and radio-tagged a random sample of 67 American beavers from the population in a certain region and recorded their movements over the course of about a year. The researchers fit a least-squares regression line to the data, where the explanatory variable was distance to lodge, in meters, and the response variable was speed, in meters per hour.\n\n(a) Is a linear model appropriate to use for these data? Justify your response by referencing the residual plot.\n\n(b) Identify the intercept of the least-squares regression line and interpret it in the context of the data.\n\n(c) The researchers plan to calculate a 95 percent confidence interval for the population slope. Identify and check the conditions for the appropriate confidence interval for the population slope.\n\n(d) The 95% confidence interval for the population slope was calculated as \\((0.751, 0.947)\\). Based on the confidence interval, do the data provide convincing statistical evidence that foragers with a central home location move faster the farther they are from home? Justify your response.",
