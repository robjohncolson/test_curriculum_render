By symmetry, 16% of the remaining times are less than 140 minutes, and 16% of the times are greater than 220 minutes.

Using technology or the standard normal table, the proportion of women who ran the marathon with a finishing time less than Kathy is approximately 0.66. Part (c): Since the standard deviation for women's times is greater than the standard deviation for men's times, there is more variability in the women's times than in the men's times.

Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nMiguel is a golfer, and he plays on the same course each week. The following table shows the probability distribution for his score on one particular hole, known as the Water Hole.\n\nLet the random variable \\(X\\) represent Miguel's score on the Water Hole. In golf, lower scores are better.\n\n(a) Suppose one of Miguel's scores from the Water Hole is selected at random. What is the probability that Miguel's score on the Water Hole is at most 5? Show your work.\n\n(b) Calculate and interpret the expected value of \\(X\\). Show your work.\n\nThe name of the Water Hole comes from the small lake that lies between the tee, where the ball is first hit, and the hole. Miguel has two approaches to hitting the ball from the tee, the short hit and the long hit. The short hit results in the ball landing before the lake. The values of \\(X\\) in the table are based on the short hit. The long hit, if successful, results in the ball traveling over the lake and landing on the other side.\n\nA potential issue with the long hit is that the ball might land in the water, which is not a good outcome. Miguel thinks that if the long hit is successful, his expected value improves to 4.2. However, if the long hit fails and the ball lands in the water, his expected value would be worse and increases to 5.4.\n\n(c) Suppose the probability of a successful long hit is 0.4. Which approach, the short hit or the long hit, is better in terms of improving the expected value of the score? Justify your answer.\n\n(d) Let \\(p\\) represent the probability of a successful long hit. What values of \\(p\\) will make the long hit better than the short hit in terms of improving the expected value of the score? Explain your reasoning.",

    "reasoning": "Of the choices given, the best reason for the skew is that the sample size was not sufficiently large. The sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough or if the population is approximately normal. Because this sampling distribution is skewed (showing a right tail), it is likely that neither of those conditions exist. The Central Limit Theorem states that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution approaches normality regardless of the population distribution shape.",

Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.\n\nA fair die, with its faces numbered from 1 to 6, is one in which each number is equally likely to land face up when the die is rolled. On a fair die, the probability that the number 6 will land face up is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). A group of students wanted to investigate a claim about manipulating a fair die so that it favors one outcome. The claim states that if a fair die is put into an oven and baked at 200°F for 10 minutes, the inside of the die will begin to melt. When the die cools, the inside will be solid again, but with more weight toward the bottom. This shift in weight will cause the face that was up when the die cooled to land up more often that the other faces.\n\nThe students obtained a fair die and baked it according to the preceding directions. The die cooled with the number 6 face up. After the die cooled, they rolled the die 200 times, and the number 6 landed face up 43 times. Let \\(p\\) represent the population proportion of times the number 6 will land face up on the baked die if the die could be rolled an infinite number of times.\n\n(a) Clarke, one of the students, constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for \\(p\\) as \\(0.215 \\pm 0.057\\). Does the interval provide convincing statistical evidence that the number 6 will land face up more often on the baked die than on a fair die? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(b) Aurelia, another student, suggested they conduct a significance test to investigate the claim. She tested the hypotheses \\(H_0: p = \\frac{1}{6}\\) versus \\(H_a: p > \\frac{1}{6}\\) at the significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). She obtained a test statistic of \\(z = 1.83\\) with a p-value of 0.033. Do the results of the significance test agree with the results of Clarke's confidence interval in part (a)? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(c) Two standard normal curves are shown below, one for the confidence interval calculated in part (a) and one for the significance test conducted in part (b).\n\n(i) For the confidence interval curve, label the critical values for the 95% confidence level and shade the area that represents values in the outer 5%.\n\n(ii) For the significance test curve, label the critical value for the 5% significance level and shade the area representing the values of \\(z\\) that would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis in part (b).\n\n(d) Joachim, a third student, noted that the confidence interval in part (a) gives plausible values of the parameter as an interval between two values. He suggested that they develop a one-sided confidence interval because they were only concerned with whether the number 6 was landing face up more often than expected, not less often. The one-sided-interval will determine a value \\(L\\) such that all plausible values of \\(p\\) are greater than \\(L\\). The formula for \\(L\\) is \\(L = \\hat{p} - z^* \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\).\n\n(i) Determine the values of \\(z^*\\) needed to create the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval. Then calculate the value of \\(L\\).\n\n(ii) Do the results of Joachim's one-sided confidence interval agree with results of Aurelia's significance test in part (b)? Explain your reasoning.",
